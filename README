This is a very simple DVD ripping script. The unique feature is output
directly to a .iso file, rather than ripping to a directory structure and
re-creating the .iso using mkisofs.

dvdrip.py

  Rip a single disc. The output file is written to ${volid}.iso where ${volid}
  is the volume name extracted from the disc itself.

dvdrip.sh

  Repeatedly calls dvdrip.sh in a loop. This is useful if you're ripping a
  number of discs in sequence; the only interaction you need is to replace the
  disc in the drive every time it ejects.

xfer.sh

  This copies each .iso file to a server using rsync. Run it in a separate
  terminal while running dvdrip.sh.

libdvdcss2.py

  A Python module that wraps libdvdcss2 using ctypes. Used to decrypt the
  DVDs during ripping.
